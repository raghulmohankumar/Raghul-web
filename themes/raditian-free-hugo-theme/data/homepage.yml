  content: |
    <p class="lead" align="justify" style="text-indent:1cm">
    I thrive at the intersection of innovation, precision, and collaboration—whether leading cross-functional projects, mentoring junior engineers, or optimizing electrical systems for efficiency and safety. Skilled in tools like EPlan, AutoCAD Electrical, ETAP, MATLAB/Simulink, I turn designs into practical, manufacturable, and high-quality products.
    </p>
    <p class="lead" align="justify" style="text-indent:1cm">
    Every project I touch is an opportunity to solve problems, improve processes, and deliver tangible results—from prototyping control panels for mining equipment to validating semiconductor products or optimizing elevator electrical systems. 
    My goal is to create solutions that are robust, reliable, and ready for the real world.
