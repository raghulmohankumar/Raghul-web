  title: "Who am I?"
  content: <p class="lead" align="justify" style = "text-indent:1cm">
        I am back, after pursuing a Master Degree in the stream of Electrical Engineering in Canada. Learning was great, the design, analytical and simulation skills have been enriched, along with the learning the Data Analytics through R Programming and started publishing the blogs. All-in-all, life has been good. I hope life has been as good for all of you.
    </p>
    <p class="lead" align="justify" style = "text-indent:1cm">
        My area of focus lies in Electrical Machines, Drives, Circuit Design, New Product Development, Product Management and Components selection, as well as co-ordinating with design & front-end teams. I enjoy designing, developing and managing electrical products as much as talking with stakeholders to iterate and improve the experiences that reach business goals.
